<!--_**I am a Infrastucture Engineer at [Krypto](https://www.letskrypto.com/), working from their Banglore Office**_. -->

I was an undergraduate student at Vellore Institute Technology, pursuing Computer Science as my major. Coding remains one
of my hobby which I want to pursue full time later on. Apart from my love of coding, I am quite fond
of [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket).

I love to analyse the different aspects of cricket, and my craze has led me to imprint it as a part
of my coding identity.
