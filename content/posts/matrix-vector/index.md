## Matrix Vector Headers

### Summary
One of the new features introduced in C++17 was the concept of a matrix and vector header, which provides a convenient way to create and manipulate matrices and vectors in C++. These headers are implemented using templates, which means that they can be used with any data type, including custom types. They are also efficient and fast, making them suitable for use in performance-critical applications.

In addition to matrix and vector headers, C++17 also introduced tensor headers, which provide a way to create and manipulate higher-dimensional arrays. These headers can be used in conjunction with matrix and vector headers to perform operations on multi-dimensional arrays of data.

When designing a matrix vector header using tensor in C++, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind:

1. Data type: Make sure to choose a data type that is appropriate for the type of data you will be storing in the matrix or vector. For example, if you are working with floating point numbers, you may want to use float or double.

2. Memory management: Pay attention to how the matrix or vector is storing its data in memory. Make sure to use an efficient and space-saving approach, such as using a contiguous block of memory or a dynamic array.

3. Operations: Think about the types of operations you will need to perform on the matrix or vector, and design your header accordingly. For example, if you will be performing matrix multiplication, make sure to include a function for that operation.

### Conclusion
Designing a matrix vector header using tensor in C++ can be a challenging but rewarding task. By considering factors such as data type, memory management, and the types of operations you will need to perform, you can create a header that is efficient, flexible, and easy to use.
