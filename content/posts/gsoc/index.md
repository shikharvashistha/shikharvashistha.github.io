## Google Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual program in which Google awards stipends to university students who contribute to open source projects during the summer. The program was first held in 2005 and has since become highly competitive, with thousands of students applying each year.

Participating in GSoC can be a great opportunity for students to gain real-world experience working on open source projects, as well as to build their resumes and network with other professionals in the field. It can also be a great way for students to give back to the open source community and contribute to projects that they use and rely on.

To participate in GSoC, students must first find a participating open source organization and submit a proposal outlining their project idea and plan. Proposals are then reviewed by the organization and, if accepted, the student is matched with a mentor who will guide them through the development process.

Throughout the program, students are expected to make regular progress updates and participate in weekly mentor meetings. At the end of the summer, students are required to submit a final report and present their project to the community.

In addition to the stipend, GSoC students also receive support from Google in the form of guidance from their mentors, access to online resources and tools, and opportunities to attend events and conferences.

Overall, participating in GSoC can be a rewarding and enriching experience for students who are interested in open source development. It can provide a unique opportunity to work on real-world projects, build their skills and knowledge, and make a meaningful contribution to the open source community.
